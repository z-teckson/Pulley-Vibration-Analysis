# Pulley Vibration Analysis

## Objective
To create a complete, version-controlled, and reproducible engineering project that takes raw torque measurement data from a large agricultural pulley, processes it to identify forcing frequencies, and uses it to set up, run, and document a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to predict the resonant behavior of the pulley.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: raw measurement data and data description
- `scripts/`: analysis and simulation scripts
- `results/`: generated plots and numerical results
- `docs/`: additional documentation

## Methodology
1. Data acquisition and preprocessing
2. Frequency analysis via FFT
3. Parametric FEA model generation
4. Modal and harmonic response analysis
5. Results visualization and reporting
